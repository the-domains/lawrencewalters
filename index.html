The basic premise is this: if you want people&#x27;s best work, you want them engaged, you want them to feel ownership. What better way to inspire that than to let them figure out how to complete a task? Tell them &quot;here&#x27;s our goal&quot; or &quot;we want to do this because it increases revenue / reduces risk / whatever&quot; and then ask them, &quot;how should we do this?&quot; Not every developer is going to have an answer, but most will. It won&#x27;t always be perfect. You can try to redirect if you think they&#x27;re off the rails. Or you can let them try their solution that you have doubts about. Often times we are working in an environment of so many different tradeoffs, that what seems obviously bad to you, but good to a developer, may just have tiny tiny differences in success. In the end, you allow them to build something they want, maybe with a touch of creativity, and they become more engaged.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-center  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="37"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="38"><p>
I want to share my first reaction to a new book I started reading - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Improving-Software-Development-Productivity-Quantitative/dp/0133562670/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">Improving Software Development Productivity: Effective Leadership and Quantitative Methods in Software Management</a> by Randall W. Jensen. I realized I've been focusing my professional development on design. We've been having a little Domain Driven Design book club, so to speak, at work. I've been reading other things focused on architecture patterns as well. So I started poking around my local public library, and came across this gem. Or, rather, what I hope to be a gem after finishing the first chapter. </p><p>It definitely has some of the trademarks of the standard business/self help book - the "why my idea is awesome" followed by "it's going to change your life" and "all other ideas are not as good." Yet the differences are in the citations and the sense that this is really more like an academic research paper, where the author is standing on the shoulders of giants (and citing them), to just make an incremental move upward. Also, I have to be honest that the technology references are old, spanning assembler (punch cards!), Fortran, Cobol, Ada, C++, to Visual Basic. In fact, I had to search for the publication date from multiple sources just to be sure 2015 was legit, and not just the digital print date. It looks like 2015 is real. He's definitely talking about Agile and waterfall, but is definitely making no serious argument in favor of either. I think the point he's really going to make is that personal communication and management are the keys to being more productive, and tools and process don't mean as much. Obviously, as a manager, this is pretty exciting to me. So far, he's got me hooked with these two graphs, from 1990s era research he cites. Basically this other guy, Weinberg, assess the relative impact to cost and productivity of 4 areas, and they fall out like this: </p><picture>

This may be super obvious in this day and age, but I think we all need reminders about its importance, especially myself. The basic premise is this: if you want people's best work, you want them engaged, you want them to feel ownership. What better way to inspire that than to let them figure out how to complete a task? Tell them \"here's our goal\" or \"we want to do this because it increases revenue / reduces risk / whatever\" and then ask them, \"how should we do this?\" Not every developer is going to have an answer, but most will.
