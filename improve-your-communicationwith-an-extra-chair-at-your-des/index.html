<p>The top example - hotel desks, almost completely isolated, nowhere for any coworker to sit next to you to collaborate, as well as a high traffic aisle behind that can be very distracting. The right example gives a nod to collaboration with the padded drawer area between stations, except in the foreground, the huge desk that sticks out wraps another station completely in desktop, preventing anyone from sitting with you.</p><p>There is actually a third option - the team room, which varies in it's success, mostly based on how many people were required to be crammed into it. They were "designed" for 8 people. Really, they weren't designed at all - we would have "seats" for pretty much everyone in Software Engineering if 8 people went in each of the team rooms. I lucked into having 5 people in mine. We were used to working elbow to elbow with laptops at a central table in our old office, so we pushed the desks together in the center to achieve that same design. </p><p>And now for the key thing I didn't realize we were doing to facilitate communication: our room came with 9 chairs, and we kept the 4 extra chairs, despite the space they took up. Keeping the chairs was not my idea originally - my team did this in the old office, and I just kept it going in the new one. </p><p>And you know why we did it in the old office? And now in the new? To let people come in and pair with us - devs, IT peeps, product managers. Even at my desk, I kept an extra chair next to me, and (most of the time) half of my desk clear to let someone drop a laptop and cop a squat with me occasionally (yeah, no one wants to pair with a manager). We were able to maintain close relationships with IT (we became the DevOps team last month because of this) through pairing. And work out any number of design issues with devs not on our team.</p><p>And that's the moral of the story - keep an extra chair at your desk so someone will stop and talk - and then stay to work with you when needed. You can turn those "fly-bys" into actual conversations that get across more detail and achieve better understanding for both you and your coworker.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Improve your communication... with an extra chair at your desk</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
