# Improve your communication... with an extra chair at your desk

I'm slowly getting through [Improving Software Development Productivity][0]by Randall W. Jensen, and the author has just presented his "Four Communication Commandments," which I thought were interesting to bring up. And, so sorry for the buzzfeed title, but \#1 is actually most interesting to me. For me, it boils down to just having an extra chair at your desk - so someone will feel welcome to come talk (and work with) you.

The "commandments" as he puts them are:

1\. Thou Shalt Not Construct Communication Barriers

2\. Thou Shalt Dedicate the Project Area

3\. Thou Shalt Provide Utensils for Creative Work

4\. Thou Shalt Not Share Resources 

Summarizing the last three (because I think they are the most obvious), are, basically, you need a space for people to work where they aren't distracted by other projects. They should have simple utensils (eg whiteboards) for radiating information to each other. And the team should be dedicated - don't have the people distracted by two different competing concerns (projects).

The detail of the "communication barriers" is a straightforward dissection of the modern programmer's office space focused on cube farms. To be fair, a lot of us no longer work in cube farms, but we work in the open office bastardization of them, which has a ton of the same problems. The basic premise of the critique is that at some point we realized open, semi private, communal spaces facilitate worker to worker and worker to manager communication, which is good. Read up on Herman Miller's Action Office or Robert Propst for some original thoughts. However, then came the facilities managers - "furniture police" - who's mandate was to control facilities cost, obviously. And this means maximizing the number of people per square foot, which entails a person, a chair, and a desk. And then another person, chair and desk right next to it. And another one. And so on. So - no open spaces, no unoccupied areas, no extra chairs or workspaces. The purported impact of this cost efficiency is lots of walls and very little person to person communication, especially any kind of collaboration that requires sitting together for an extended period.

Reading this, it seems very obvious. It is also a serious indictment of most office spaces I've worked in. At Enova, we moved into new space last year, the execution of the floorplan turns out to be terrible in hindsight. There were two main fixed seating styles (photos taken shamelessly from [Office Snapshots][1]):

The top example - hotel desks, almost completely isolated, nowhere for any coworker to sit next to you to collaborate, as well as a high traffic aisle behind that can be very distracting. The right example gives a nod to collaboration with the padded drawer area between stations, except in the foreground, the huge desk that sticks out wraps another station completely in desktop, preventing anyone from sitting with you.

There is actually a third option - the team room, which varies in it's success, mostly based on how many people were required to be crammed into it. They were "designed" for 8 people. Really, they weren't designed at all - we would have "seats" for pretty much everyone in Software Engineering if 8 people went in each of the team rooms. I lucked into having 5 people in mine. We were used to working elbow to elbow with laptops at a central table in our old office, so we pushed the desks together in the center to achieve that same design. 

And now for the key thing I didn't realize we were doing to facilitate communication: our room came with 9 chairs, and we kept the 4 extra chairs, despite the space they took up. Keeping the chairs was not my idea originally - my team did this in the old office, and I just kept it going in the new one. 

And you know why we did it in the old office? And now in the new? To let people come in and pair with us - devs, IT peeps, product managers. Even at my desk, I kept an extra chair next to me, and (most of the time) half of my desk clear to let someone drop a laptop and cop a squat with me occasionally (yeah, no one wants to pair with a manager). We were able to maintain close relationships with IT (we became the DevOps team last month because of this) through pairing. And work out any number of design issues with devs not on our team.

And that's the moral of the story - keep an extra chair at your desk so someone will stop and talk - and then stay to work with you when needed. You can turn those "fly-bys" into actual conversations that get across more detail and achieve better understanding for both you and your coworker.
