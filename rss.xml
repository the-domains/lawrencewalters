            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book: Improving Software Development Productivity</h1><p>
I want to share my first reaction to a new book I started reading - Improving Software Development Productivity: Effective Leadership and Quantitative Methods in Software Management by Randall W. Jensen. I realized I've been focusing my professional development on design. We've been having a little Domain Driven Design book club, so to speak, at work. I've been reading other things focused on architecture patterns as well. So I started poking around my local public library, and came across this gem. Or, rather, what I hope to be a gem after finishing the first chapter. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/02018757729eec46b9f68d6b67467a8129af31a1.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Improve your communication... with an extra chair at your desk</h1><p>I'm slowly getting through Improving Software Development Productivityby Randall W. Jensen, and the author has just presented his "Four Communication Commandments," which I thought were interesting to bring up. And, so sorry for the buzzfeed title, but #1 is actually most interesting to me. For me, it boils down to just having an extra chair at your desk - so someone will feel welcome to come talk (and work with) you.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/08c7e0255d62021de187819550770b42dcc48891.jpg"></article>]]></description>
