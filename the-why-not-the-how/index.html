This may be super obvious in this day and age, but I think we all need reminders about its importance, especially myself. The basic premise is this: if you want people's best work, you want them engaged, you want them to feel ownership. What better way to inspire that than to let them figure out how to complete a task? Tell them "here's our goal" or "we want to do this because it increases revenue / reduces risk / whatever" and then ask them, "how should we do this?" Not every developer is going to have an answer, but most will. It won't always be perfect. You can try to redirect if you think they're off the rails. Or you can let them try their solution that you have doubts about. Often times we are working in an environment of so many different tradeoffs, that what seems obviously bad to you, but good to a developer, may just have tiny tiny differences in success. In the end, you allow them to build something they want, maybe with a touch of creativity, and they become more engaged.</p><p>I thought I would share a funny anecdote that is one I often revisit in my mind that really drives this point home. Some of you may or may not know I used to work for a trading firm, and for a while in a foreign country (bonus points if you can name the country). It was a small office, and I was the IT guy - still a burgeoning programmer at this point. I supported about 10 users, and the head trader was my boss, who shall remain nameless. One day I get a call at my desk.</p><p>"This is Lawrence," I answered.</p><p>"Bring me a longer mouse cable," he says without introduction.</p><p>"Why? What's the issue?"</p><p>"Just bring me a longer mouse cable."</p><p>You can probably guess where this is going. I thought that he just needed more freedom to move the mouse around on his trading desk, and it was probably not routed properly from the back of the machine to the desk. I figured I would run over to his desk - literally, run - re-route the cable, and call it done. I don't know that I actually had any kind of extension for the cable at the time, but regardless, I thought I knew how to resolve his core issue.</p><p>Showing up empty handed was not the right move. He immediately jumped on me.</p><p>"Why didn't you bring an extension?" he asked.</p><p>"Let me just take a look," I replied.</p><p>"No. Get me an extension."</p><p>I was starting to get flustered, but re-routed the cable to get him a good eighteen additional inches. Plenty of slack to move the mouse wherever he might need on the tiny slice of trading desk not covered by keyboard, printouts or monitors. But he would not be satisfied.</p><p>"Why won't you get me an extension?"</p><p>I just stared blankly. I thought I had nailed this one. He clearly disagreed.</p><p>"I asked for an extension, why didn't you bring it?"</p><p>For better or worse, he was picking up my nonverbal cues that I would not be doing that.</p><p>"Do you want to step outside?"</p><p>What? Again, I stared blankly.</p><p>"Is that what I have to do to get a longer mouse cable? Do you want to step outside with me?"</p><p>Realization dawned. He was asking if I wanted to fight him in the street over the exact way I wanted to fix his mousing issue! I quickly fled the scene to avoid the actual fight that, by that point, both of us very much wanted to have.</p><p>Luckily that's the only time my manager has ever asked to fight me. It was also a very obvious case of telling an employee exactly how to do their job. We didn't discuss his real need, or why his solution might even be better than mine. And this directly led to me wanting to get the heck out of there.</p><p>While I don't have a positive example of this principle, I think this anti pattern shows a pretty decent (and more dramatic!) example of how micro managing reduces engagement. I would love to hear your story of that time you got the "how" and not the "why."</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">lawrencewalters</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
